            <br>
            Originally from the coastal city of Corpus Christi, I decided to pursue an education at the University of
            Texas at Austin after graduating high school in the top 10% of my class. I enrolled at UT with a focus in
            Advertisement, but eventually switched my focus to Radio-Television-Film. After receiving my Bachelor of
            Science in Radio-Television-Film in 2018, I enrolled in UT's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp in 2020.
            <br><br>
            My higher education led me to discover an interest in telecommunications and computer science, by learning
            the history, as well as the modern impact on society and our daily lives. I leveraged this newfound insight
            by entering Austin's ever expanding tech industry as a Technical Support Representative for BigCommerce, a
            leading E-Commerce company.
            <br><br>
            Currently, I spend my career troubleshooting storefronts from small business to enterprise level. I love to
            assist my clients and colleagues in understanding and achieving the fullest potential of our product. I
            spend my time analyzing error reports, assisting with front-end design, database management, as well as
            installing countless integrations in order to find the best E-Commerce solutions for every business.

            Smith's X-treme Cleaners sells multi-purpose cleaning products, specializing in the treatment of boats. New
            to the world of E-Commerce, they were eager to hit the ground running, so I gave a complete overhaul of
            their freshly created shop.
            <br><br>
            Design work included updating color schemes to reflect their brand, creating new web pages, and removing
            product backgrounds. I also improved their SEO with image tags, page keywords, and relevent links to social
            media. I improved conversions by adding a product slideshow, reviews, and newsletter.

            Red Bag is a functional E-Commerce application built from extensive collaboration between myself and a
            couple classmates at UT's Full Stack Web Development bootcamp. The app allows users to create accounts, post
            products for sale, and
            provide reviews for sellers. Red Bag was built with Node.js and utilizes a MySQL
            database.<br><br>Dependencies included: Dotenv, Express, Google Cloud Storage, Handlebars, Multer, MySQL2,
            Nodemon, SCSS, and Sequelize.
